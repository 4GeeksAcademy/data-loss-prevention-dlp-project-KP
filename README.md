## üå± How to Start This Project
This exercise focuses on the creation and implementation of security policies for **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)** within an organization, applying the principle of least privilege and ensuring that only authorized personnel have access to sensitive data.

### üîë General Objective:
- **Part 1**: Define and establish DLP policies that help protect confidential information.
- **Part 2**: Implement specific measures, such as **restricting the use of USB devices**, to ensure that DLP policies are applied in practice.

## üìù Instructions

### Creation of DLP Security Policies

1. **Introduction to Data Loss Prevention.** Write an introduction to DLP, explaining the general concept of DLP and its importance within an organization, highlighting its role in protecting confidential data.

2. **Data Classification.** Define how the organization will classify data based on its sensitivity. Establish at least three classification categories, for example:

    - Public Data
    - Internal Data
    - Sensitive Data

3. **Access and Control.** Apply the principle of least privilege by establishing access policies based on this principle, and define the permission review workflow, indicating which roles within the organization will be responsible for these reviews and how they will be carried out.

4. **Monitoring and Auditing.** Establish rules for monitoring sensitive data and auditing activities related to that data. Provide more detailed descriptions of the monitoring and auditing tools that will be used (e.g., SIEM solutions or specific DLP tools to monitor data usage).

5. **Leak Prevention.** Define how the leakage of sensitive data will be prevented, using technologies such as encryption and DLP tools.

6. **Education and Awareness.** Describe how staff will be trained on security policies and the associated risks.

### üìÅ Example of Real Case Report

For a practical illustration, refer to the [Data Loss Prevention Case Study](assets/SecurityPolicyReport.pdf). This example focuses on the use of **Google Drive**, but it can be adapted to any cloud or local storage or collaboration system. The key is ensuring that only authorized users access the information as needed to perform their work, always respecting the **Principle of Least Privilege**.

## Implementation of USB Device Restriction Policies

The second part of this exercise involves implementing policies to restrict the use of **USB devices**. These restrictions are essential to prevent the leakage of confidential data through removable storage devices. This policy is directly linked to the DLP policies created in the first part of the exercise.

> üí° The following practice will focus on a Windows virtual machine.

### Configuring a machine for USB device access

> ‚ö† To carry out this practice and apply restrictions on USB device access, we must ensure that the VM we are working on can access the USB devices connected to your physical machine (host). Follow these steps:

1. **Install VirtualBox Extension Pack**. Go to the official VirtualBox website and download the Extension Pack that matches the installed version.
2. Open VirtualBox, go to File > Tools > Extensions and select the downloaded file to install it.
3. **Enable USB Support on the VM**. Shut down the virtual machine if it is running, select the VM in VirtualBox, click `Settings > Ports > USB`, and enable the `USB 2.0 (EHCI) Controller` or `USB 3.0 (xHCI) Controller`, depending on the port you are using.
4. **Connect the USB device to the VM.** Start the VM and connect the USB device to your physical machine. In the VM menu, select `Devices > USB` and choose the connected device. The VM will take control of the USB.

Once this is done successfully, let's get started!

### USB Device Restriction in Windows

1. **Open the Group Policy Editor.** Press `Win + R`, type `gpedit.msc`, and press Enter to open the Group Policy Editor.

2. **Navigate to Removable Storage Policies.** Go to Computer `Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > Removable Storage Access`.

3. **Configure the Policy to Deny Access to USB Devices.** Enable the following policies:

- Removable Disks: Deny read access.
- Removable Disks: Deny write access.

> This will prevent users from reading or writing to connected USB devices.

4. Restart the virtual machine to apply the changes.


### Validation and Testing of USB Restriction

1. **Test the USB Restriction.** Connect a USB device to the VM and try to access it from a standard user account (without administrative privileges).
2. **Verify Access Restriction.** If the policies are correctly configured, standard users should not be able to access the USB device, and a message should appear indicating the denial of access.

### Creation and Testing of a Regular User

1. **Create a new regular user in Windows.** Open Settings (Win + I), go to `Accounts > Family & other users`.

2. Click `Add someone else to this PC`, select `I don‚Äôt have this person‚Äôs sign-in information`, then `Add a user without a Microsoft account`.

3. Create the user with a name and password (this will be a standard user without privileges).

4. **Test the restriction with the regular user.** Log in with the new regular user and connect the USB device to verify that access is denied due to the applied restrictions.

### Enabling Exceptions for Specific Users

We assume that by this point you are a confident student, so we ask you to research how to enable exceptions for specific users. The idea is that you log in with an administrator account, open the `Group Policy Editor`, and investigate how to enable exceptions in the USB device policies for certain users or groups of users.

Finally, you should verify that the exceptions have been applied by conducting tests with different users.
